# planets
A program which uses physics concepts, such as the gravitational force equation, law of conservation of momentum, and Newton's famous second law of motion, to create a somewhat unwieldly but fun game where you play as a space marine.

This uses a Python library called pyglet which is a high-level binding to OpenGL, much like how pygame is bound to SDL.
